- showdown as simulation environment
- how to implement mega evolution and z moves?
    - have specific preconditions and can only be triggered once
- use new user for each training run
- multiple pokemon of same species in teams?
- smogon rules
- ban zoroark
- infinite battle
    - eg switch-in loop
    - average duration: 60 turns
    - smogon endless battle clause
    - possible solution: tie after 500 turns
- asynchronous rl/multiple agents (ppo, a3c, ...)
- self-play rl?
    - AI agent probably faster than humans on average
    - compatible with gym?
    - implementations exist?
- play against humans? is there an opponent simulator?
- random teams
    - seperate team building agent?
- elo rating as performance measure?
    - starts with 1000
